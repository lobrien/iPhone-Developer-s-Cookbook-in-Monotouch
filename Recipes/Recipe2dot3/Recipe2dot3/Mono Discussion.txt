A potentially interesting thing here is the use of XML serialization in DragViewController.UpdateDefaults()
to store the preferences. When I tried to use the .NET List<> objects, I was told that 
they could not be implicitly converted to an NSObject. Since XML serialization
in .NET is very straightforward (albeit not highly performant), I didn't search
terribly long for an alternative.
